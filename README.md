#  Bundle Builder - Coding Assessment L2

Welcome to the **Bundle Builder** project — a front-end coding assessment for Level 2, created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** without any frameworks or libraries.

This project simulates a **Shopify-style custom bundle builder**, allowing users to select products, view bundle progress, calculate discounts, and proceed with a simulated checkout.
